# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The goal is to create a simple yet effective model for predicting house prices using basic features.

## Kaggle Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from Kaggle. It includes information about various houses, including their square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and corresponding prices.

**Kaggle Dataset Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

Please download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory before running the code.

## Model Used
We have implemented a linear regression model for this prediction task. Linear regression is a basic and widely used algorithm for predicting a continuous variable, making it suitable for predicting house prices based on the given features.

The model is trained on the provided dataset, and its performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
